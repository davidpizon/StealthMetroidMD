notes:

sprite visibility needs to be checked

need animation for running attack

Change animations only when necessary. Don't waste time animating things that might not be used in the end

parameter tweaking from now on. Tweak until it's fun!
Parameters to tweak:
- AI attack timing << changed method to something that looks reasonable
- player attack range << seems ok
- player attack speed <<
- player parry animation length << fine
- npc parry stagger time <<ok
- can only attack standing or at max speed << ok
- AI behavior:
-- maybe they shouldn't jump off cliffs 
-- side step during combat


parameters look ok-ish for now.
Maybe it needs some juicy gamey effects to bring it up to standards. Animation, freeze frames for impact etc. 

tired of combat for now. I think it's serviceable as is. 

Moving on to visibility and stealth

the AI head icons are too small to be readable with a CRT filter. Besides, I'm not sure how to use them with the current AI system
