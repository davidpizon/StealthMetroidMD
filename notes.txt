notes:



Combat parameters to tweak:
- AI attack timing << changed method to something that looks reasonable
- player attack range << seems ok
- player attack speed <<
- player parry animation length << fine
- npc parry stagger time <<ok
- can only attack standing or at max speed << ok
- pushback when hit (player)
- change control scheme to: A up parry, A left/right sidestep, c jumps running, c hold jumps vertically standing <<i like it!
parameters look ok-ish for now.
Maybe it needs some juicy gamey effects to bring it up to standards. Animation, freeze frames for impact etc. 

- AI behavior:
-- maybe they shouldn't jump off cliffs 
-- fall damage



the AI head icons are too small to be readable with a CRT filter. Besides, I'm not sure how to use them with the current AI system



ANIMATION NOTES:
- running animation might require double length instead of this fake thing
need animation for running attack
Change animations only when necessary. Don't waste time animating things that might not be used in the end

Things to add for the short demo:
- Crawl NOT NEEDED ATM
- doors DONE
- look up and down
- an impossible to defeat mechanism, like a camera, or something that functions like a soft door DONE
- stairs? some means of vertical locomotion for npcs (and the player) specially for indoor locs DONE
- tweak inertia
- change combat toggle
- add light shadow to demo
- make crouching bumpable
